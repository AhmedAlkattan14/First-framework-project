# React Simple Project

## Description

This is a simple React application demonstrating essential React concepts:

- **Context Provider** for shared state management.
- **Layout** component that includes **Nav** for navigation and **Outlet** for rendering routed content.
- Usage of **useState** for managing local component state.
- Usage of **useEffect** for side effects like updating UI or fetching data.

The project is designed to showcase clean component structure and basic state management in React.

## Features

- Context-based state management across components.
- Navigation bar with dynamic routing.
- Functional components using React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
- Organized layout structure for scalable app design.
